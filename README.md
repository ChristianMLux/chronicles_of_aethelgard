**Chronicles of Aethelgard** is a Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) strategy game set in a persistent high-fantasy world. Lead your civilization from the ruins of a magical age, build powerful cities, forge mighty armies, and conquer your place in a shattered world.

The game combines elements of Real-Time Strategy (RTS), City-Building Simulation, and 4X Strategy (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate).

## üìú Lore & Vision

The world of Aethelgard is defined by the contrast between the lost, elegant splendor of the "Age of Harmony" and the harsh, pragmatic struggle for survival in the "Age of Decay." As the leader of a group of survivors, you discover a shard of a God's Tear, which allows you to tame the wild mana and found a new civilization.

The visual style follows the vision of "Lost Splendor & Rough New Beginnings"‚Äîa blend of high fantasy and a magical post-apocalypse, with influences from Gothic architecture and Roman antiquity.

## ‚ú® Core Features (Current Status)

This project is under active development. The following core mechanics are already implemented and playable:
